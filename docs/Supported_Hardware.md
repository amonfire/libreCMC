# libreCMC supported Hardware

Officially supported devices generally fall into one of three categories : can
easily be flashed from the stock firmware's web-ui, requires the usage of a tFTP
server or the device must be opened. When choosing a router to use with libreCMC,
please keep in mind the method which is required for the initial install of
libreCMC. Unless otherwise noted, the listed devices fall into the first
category [1].
