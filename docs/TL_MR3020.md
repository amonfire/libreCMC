## Flashing from factory (virgin)

### Using Web GUI (Recommended)

1) Set TL-MR3020 Mode Switch to either 3G/4G or WISP

2) Connect to the TL-MR3020 router via Ethernet cable

3) Open IP address 192.168.0.254

4) log in to the router's web GUI (default login/password: admin / admin)

5) overwrite the factory firmware by installing the openwrt-ar71xx-generic-tl-mr3020-v1-squashfs-factory.bin firmware image like a regular firmware update.

Wait for the progress bar to finish twice (the device will reset itself in the process), and proceed with basic configuration as with any fresh libreCMC install.

### Flashing from libreCMC Web GUI

1) Connect device to ethernet port on your computer and set the ip address of your machine to 192.168.1.10

2) Open 192.168.1.1 in a browser.

3) Go to: System -> Backup/Flash Firmware

4) Click the "browse" button under the _Flash New Firmware image_ section.

5) Upload a firmware image with : librecmc-_target_-generic-_profile_-squashfs-factory.bin

6) wait for the web interface to appear again (unless you chose to flash an image without it).
